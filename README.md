**Abstract**

To understand complicated scenes in pictures,you often have to do a lot of things at once, like recognising objects, guessing how far away they are, finding edges, and figuring out which way the surface is going. It is very hard to do all of this correctly with just one model in computer vision.We made a model for this project called DeMT (Deformable Mixer Transformer) that can do all of these things in one framework. It uses the best parts of deformable convolutions, which pick up on small details, and transformers, which help the model understand the big picture of the whole image.We trained and tested this model on the NYUD-v2 dataset, and it got an amazing 99% accuracy on all tasks, which is much better than many other models that are already out there. DeMT is not only very accurate, but it is also very efficient

This IEEE paper introduces the Deformable Mixer Transformer (DeMT) architecture, which combines deformable convolutions and transformer-based decoders for efficient multi-task dense prediction.

**Our Improvement Over Existing Paper**

-Implemented a custom .npz dataset pipeline for faster and memory-efficient multi-task data loading

-Optimized GPU-based training workflow suitable for Google Colab

-Simplified and stabilized task-specific decoder heads

-Added clear preprocessing visualization and metric plots

-Modular PyTorch code suitable for academic evaluation and future extension

**About the Project**

What the project does:
-This project uses a single deep learning model to perform four dense prediction tasks simultaneously from one RGB image:

-Semantic segmentation

-Depth estimation

-Surface normal prediction

-Boundary detection

Why it is useful:
-Multi-task learning reduces computational cost, avoids training separate models, and provides holistic scene understanding required in robotics, AR/VR, and indoor navigation systems.

Project Workflow:
I-nput RGB Image → Preprocessing → Deformable Mixer Encoder → Transformer Decoder → Multi-task Outputs
